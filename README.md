# theCensor
This project for HackSussex hackathon 2019 aims to identify and close inappropriate adult content in a Window or browser. The objective is to remove this type of content when the user did not specifically search for it.

At the moment, the model detects inappropriate content and execute the hotkey ```Ctrl+W```.
